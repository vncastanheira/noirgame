Welcome to Noir Game
====================

1. Controls:
	- Right and Left arrows controls the player
	- Z shoots, but only in a spotlight
	- R restarts the level. 
	- Esc button exits the game.

2. Instructions:
	Noir Game is a game of strategy and shooting with multiple endings.
On the final level, your choices will determine which message you get
in the end.
The goal is to kill the enemies on the levels (although it's optional)
and move to the next level. The more enemies you kill, the more evilness
point you get.
	To shoot, make sure you are in the spotlight, indicated by a red exclamation
mark on your head. This means that you can be seen by the enemies if they face
an opposite direction than yours. It also means that you can be killed, since
that if you are in the dark, the enemy's bullets don't hit you.
On the other hand, the exclamation mark on the enemies's head shows that they
are seeing you and will shoot you at the very moment.
	You receive 2 points for each enemy kill and a -5 penalty for each death.
	Restarting the level doesn't take any penalty.
	The game have 6 levels and a final one.
	Good luck, evil guy!

3. History:
	You are a thief, invading a rich man's house to steal his money.
	In the end, you got more than one choice.

4. Final Considerations:
	This game was made in less than 2 days for the 25th edition of Ludum Dare.
	The Pyganim module was made by Al Sweigart, to make Pygame animations.
	All the work was done by myself and the music was composed by my friend. You 
can find us on the links provided below.
